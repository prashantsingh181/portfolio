## Overview

**Shopperce** is a multi-tenant eCommerce platform built with **React + Vite**, designed to help partners launch their own customized online stores. Each partner can configure their store’s theme, layout, and catalog independently — all powered by a single, flexible frontend codebase.

The goal was to create a reusable, scalable system where multiple brands could run on the same application while maintaining their unique identity and experience.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Built a dynamic configuration system allowing multiple partners to use the same app with unique themes, routes, and branding.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Each partner can have a distinct design and UI, loaded dynamically at runtime based on configuration fetched from an API.
- **Configurable Routing System**: Implemented logic to dynamically import routes and components from theme-specific folders before app initialization.
- **Reusable Components**: Developed modular UI components adaptable across different themes for consistent functionality and design flexibility.
- **Product Management**: Integrated product listing, variant handling, and inventory logic for sellers within each partner domain.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Used lazy loading and dynamic imports to load only the required components for each partner, improving load times.
- **Error Monitoring**: Integrated Sentry for real-time error tracking and debugging across multiple partner sites.

## Technologies Used

- **React + Vite**: For a fast, modular, and modern frontend setup.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with APIs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For flexible and theme-driven styling.
- **React Router**: For dynamic routing across partner-specific pages.
- **Sentry**: For monitoring and debugging.
- **Git + GitHub**: For version control and team collaboration.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was designing a structure that supports multiple partners with unique UI themes without duplicating logic. This was solved using a **dynamic import and configuration pattern**, allowing each theme to load its own components and styles based on API data.

Additionally, ensuring consistent performance across tenants required optimizing bundle size and caching strategies. Through this, I learned to design scalable React architectures and implement configuration-driven UI systems effectively.

## Outcome

**Shopperce** successfully supports multiple partner storefronts with unique branding, themes, and product catalogs — all running on the same frontend application.  
It has reduced development overhead for new partners, improved scalability, and provided a flexible foundation for expanding into new markets efficiently.
